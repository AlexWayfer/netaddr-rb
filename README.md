# netaddr
A Ruby library for performing calculations on IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. There is also limited support for EUI addresses.

I originally created 1.x branch back in 2007 out of the need for a tool which I could use to track an
inventory of constantly changing IP subnets.

# Status
I intend to update this code base. The original 1.x code is, quite frankly, horrible and embarrassing since I was
new to Ruby when I wrote it. The 2.x code base will not be compatible with the 1.x branch and I plan to simplify things greatly.

# Contributing
Once I decide on the basic classes then I will welcome others to port over any methods which they may need but are missing.
